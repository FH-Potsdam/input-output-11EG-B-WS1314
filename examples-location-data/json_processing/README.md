json_processing
===============

A processing sketch for reading and displaying .json files created by [openpaths.cc](openpaths.cc). This sketch is part of the course ["Eingabe, Ausgabe. Grundlagen der prozessorientierten Gestaltung"](https://incom.org/workspace/4693) by Monika Hoinkis  

Reading a JSON file could also be done using the [loadJsonArray()](http://processing.org/reference/loadJSONArray_.html) method of processing. It is more a "proof of concept" sketch that mixes Processing with JavaScript in the Processing JavaScript mode.
