##DESCRIPTION  
Poster made with eye-tracking results from a read songtext. First a test person looked at 3 wordclouds shaped as letters. The way the person looked at the source material was recorded by a Tobii Eytracker. The actual output was generated out of the recorded data using a Processing sketch.
