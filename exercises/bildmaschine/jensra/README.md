This sketch visualised the eyetracking data collected by the Tobii Eyetracking system.  
First part: Poem "Melusine" by Loriot, displayed in different layouts.  
Second part: "Das ist das Haus vom Nikolaus".  
  
The eyetracker's data (.txt, separated by tabs) can be found in the folder "csvfiles" within the Processing sketch folder.
